CIS-560-Ray-Tracer
==================
I created ray tracer project using C++ and OpenGL. 
The ray tracer was completed by:
1. Implemented rotation and translation of different types of geometries.

2. Implemented intersection units for unit objects, include sphere, cube and cylinder. 

3. Implemented ray tracing algorithm by sending a ray from the eye through all objects in the scene (less than 5 recursion depth)

4. Added direct illumination and shadows. 

5. Added specular reflections by sending reflected rays into the scene. 

6. Composited the data from different light and represented them in terms of RGB value in each pixel.
